 *
 * \brief Abstracts the AVR analogic to digital peripheral.
 *
 * From this module standpoint, the AVR ADC services are based on:
 *  -# A set of physical analogic channels attached to physical pins 
 *     (some of them shared with digital ports); 
 *  -# A set of reference sources that are used to
 *     compare with the analogic signals beig converted.
 *  -# A hardware that reads a physical channel, compares
 *     its value to a reference source and returns the corresponding
 *     digital value.
 *
 * The center of this module is the #sdc_channel. An #sdc_channel is
 * a logical file-like object that abstracts a physical analogic
 * channel together with its reference source.
 * 
 * The functions of this module are operations on the #sdc_channel. A
 * typical use would follow this pattern:
 *
 *  -# Bind the logical channel to a physical channel and a reference
 *     source.
 *  -# Prepare the logical channel to be sampled.
 *  -# Request a sampling action to the channel.
 *  -# When sampled: get the value.
 *  -# Unbound the channel.
 *
 * Some functions are canned combinations of basic operations to allow
 * an easier use on simple cases.
